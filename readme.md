- Side by side realtime editing experience by design.

### In The Kit
- Mobx powered data store and Components which enables the flow of the data into the application.
- Admin interface which enables to authorized users to manage the data in a CMS like fashion.
- Automatic Firebase integration, all you need is to provide the configuration object supplied by firebase.


### The Admin Interface
The admin interface is a completely optional but extremely powerful tool. 
Customize it to suit your specific product in minutes, or disable it completely. 
Either way It loads asyncronousely only when it's needed so it wont effect your app's load time at all.
